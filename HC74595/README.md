# HC74595 Arduino Library

Controlling 74HC595 IC using Arduino

## Description

The purpose of this library is to facilitate the control of 74HC595 from the Arduino programming environment. This library gives the user the ability to directly control the 8 output terminals in the 74HC595 IC separately and directly. Only one byte is used to store the output data in one IC. Therefore, the library allows the microcontroller to control a large output number using a very small amount of RAM. Check the example_Folder for more information on the library.

## Getting Started

Examples are provided for all the functions in the library. Check the example folder for more details.
